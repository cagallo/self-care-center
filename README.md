# Self Care Center

Fully Deployed Site <a href="https://cagallo.github.io/self-care-center/">Here</a>

## Overview
How can I care for myself? One way is with affirmations and mantras!
Affirmations are thoughts of positive self-empowerment, meant to assert your self-worth.
Mantras are repetitive phrases that are repeated again and again during mindfulness practices. Your challenge is to build an app that helps users remind themselves of their inherent value!

The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/self-care-center.html).

## Functionality

- Users can select affirmation or mantra and have a corresponding message appear on the page.
- Users can clear their message after it appears on the screen by clicking the Clear Message button below the message box.
